Name:The Way I See Things
Author:Lil Peep
Cuplet:1
I got a feelin' that I'm not gonna be here for next year
So, let's laugh a little before I'm gone
I've been dreamin' of this shit for a while now
Got me high now
Cuplet:2
She don't love me but she singin' my songs
I don't feel much pain
Got a knife in my back and a bullet in my brain
I'm clinically insane
Walkin' home alone, I see faces in the rain
Where did all the time go?
Cuplet:3
Spend it gettin' high while I hide from the 5-0
Where did all the lines go?
Now I'm so high, I be fuckin' with my eyes closed
She don't fuck with me no more, I'm on her mind though
Come and fuck me in the mornin' with the blinds closed
I can show you everything I learned while you were away from me
Runnin' away from me, but I'm not giving up on you
Cuplet:4
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things
Take her away from me, but I'm not giving up on you, no
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things
