Name:The Way I See Things
Author:Lil Peep
Couplet:1
I got a feelin' that I'm not gonna be here for next year
So, let's laugh a little before I'm gone
I've been dreamin' of this shit for a while now
Got me high now
Couplet:2
She don't love me but she singin' my songs
I don't feel much pain
Got a knife in my back and a bullet in my brain
Couplet:3
Spend it gettin' high while I hide from the 5-0
Where did all the lines go?
Now I'm so high, I be fuckin' with my eyes closed
